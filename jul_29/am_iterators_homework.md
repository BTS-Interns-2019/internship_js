# Array Iterator Methods Homework

* file name `am_iterators_homerowk_<name>.js` for function definition.

* function name `charCounter`.

* Create a function that receives 1 string as parameter and returns an object indicating how many times a letter was used.
* Each key of the object will be a used letter in lowercase
* Any character that is not a letter must be ignored
* for, while, do...while loops are forbidden

## Example I/O
```
"Hi Every body!" => {
  h: 1,
  i: 1,
  e: 2,
  v: 1,
  r: 1,
  y: 2,
  b: 1,
  o: 1,
  d: 1,
}
```

## TDD

* Create a tests file with the same name but ending in .test.js aka `am_iterators_homework_<name>.tests.js`
* Write at least 3 different test cases for the excersise

> TIP: remember: forEach,  map,  filter,  reduce,  reduceRight.
