```js
string = 'some words Like this'
```

you may receive empty spaces at the beginning of the string or at the end, you should remove those. Symbols such as !"Â·%/()= are part of the word the only thing that split a word is an empty space. You may also receive a empty string in which you need to return a empty string as well.
