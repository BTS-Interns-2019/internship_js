# Test afternoon

There are 4 folders at the same level as this file, each one is an exercise, there is a .md file which has the specifications for the function, the .js file with the function already created and a test.js with some tests already defined.

The first thing you need to do is carefully read the specifications of the exercise, then review some of the tests created, also you need to create more tests first covering most of the cases you can think of and then jump to do the exercise.

always validate you are getting the correct input in your functions if you are not getting what you were expecting throw an error saying so.

good luck :)
